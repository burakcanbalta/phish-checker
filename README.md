**Phish Checker** is a lightweight, browser-based tool to help identify suspicious URLs.  
It performs basic checks to detect phishing attempts based on known techniques used in malicious links.

## üîç What is this for?

Phishing attacks often trick users by disguising harmful URLs to look like legitimate ones.  
**Phish Checker** analyzes a URL and highlights signs that may indicate it is unsafe, such as:

- Use of raw IP addresses instead of domain names
- Inclusion of an "@" symbol to mislead users about the actual destination
- Excessive use of subdomains to obscure the true host

This tool is designed for:

- Cybersecurity learners and educators
- CTF (Capture The Flag) challenges
- Phishing awareness and training programs
- Developers who want to integrate basic phishing checks into small-scale tools

It works entirely in the browser ‚Äî **no internet connection required**, and **no data is sent anywhere**.
